      <div class="row-fluid">
        <p class="lead">At Magnum we have a firm rule that all CPAN modules
          on our machines are installed from RPMs. The Fedora and Centos
          projects build RPMs for many CPAN modules, but there are always ones
          missing and the ones that are available often lag behind the most up
          to date versions.</p>

        <p>For that reason, we build a lot of RPMs of CPAN modules. And we don't
          want to keep that work to ourselves, so on these pages we make them
          available for anyone to download.</p>

        <div class="panel panel-info">

          </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
        <p>Currently we have RPMs available for the following distributions (as
          these are the distributions that we use):

        <ul>
           <li><a href="/Centos/7/">Centos 7</a></li>
           <li><a href="/Fedora/32/">Fedora 32</a></li>

        <div class="panel-body">
        <p>We also have packages available for older versions of Centos and 
          Fedora, but these packages are no longer maintained or refreshed.
          Packages for the following versions are available:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Centos: <a href="/Centos/5/">5</a>,
                      <a href="/Centos/6/">6</a></li>
          <li>Fedora: <a href="/Fedora/9/">9</a>,
                      <a href="/Fedora/10/">10</a>,

                      <a href="/Fedora/17/">17</a>,
                      <a href="/Fedora/18/">18</a>,
                      <a href="/Fedora/19/">19</a>,
                      <a href="/Fedora/20/">20</a>,
                      <a href="/Fedora/21/">21</a>,
                      <a href="/Fedora/22/">22</a>,
                      <a href="/redora/23/">23</a>,
                      <a href="/Fedora/24/">24</a>,
                      <a href="/Fedora/25/">25</a>,
                      <a href="/Fedora/26/">26</a>,
                      <a href="/Fedora/27/">27</a>,
                      <a href="/Fedora/28/">28</a>,
                      <a href="/Fedora/29/">29</a>,
                      <a href="/Fedora/30/">30</a>,
                      <a href="/Fedora/31/">31</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>For some older versions we have support for both i386 and x86_64
          architectures. More recently we have only been supporting x86_64.</p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <p>These repositories are built to work with <tt>yum</tt> (or, more
          recently, <tt>dnf</tt>), the standard command line package manager
          for Fedora and Centos. In order to to use these repositories with
          <tt>yum</tt> or <tt>dnf</tt> on your system you should download
          the correct configuration file (either
          <a href="/Fedora/magnum.repo">Fedora</a> or
          <a href="/Centos/magnum.repo">Centos</a>) and place it in your
          <tt>/etc/yum.repos.d/</tt> directory. This will also add the Magnum
          repository to the list available from the GUI package management tool
          PackageKit. I'll be creating RPMs for these configuation files
          shortly.</p>

        <p>We are trying not to repeat other people's work here. So we don't
          build RPMs for modules that are already supplied by other well-known
          RPM repositories (although we may sometimes make a newer version
          available when it's required to build an RPM that we are interested
          in). This means that our RPMs may well depend on RPMs that are already
          available from other sources. The other repositories that we use vary
          between Fedora and Centos. Currently they are:</p>

        <p><em>Fedora</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The standard Fedora repository</li>
          <li><a href="https://rpmfusion.org/">RPM Fusion</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Centos</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The standard Centos repository</li>
          <li><a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">EPEL</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://repoforge.org/">Repoforge</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>You'll need to configure <tt>yum</tt>/<tt>dnf</tt> to use the
          appropriate repositories in order to guarantee being able to use
          our RPMs.</p>

        <p>Note that the RPMs from our repository are not currently signed.
          This is something that we want to add add as soon as possible.</p>

        <p>In the not too distant future we hope to automate the building of
          these RPMs so that a new version will appear here soon after it is
          uploaded to CPAN. Watch this space for more details on that.</p>

<!--
        <p>Finally, we've started a project which is investigating the
          possibility of automatically building RPMs from all of CPAN. This
          project is only in its very early stages, but we have a 
          <a href="http://lists.mag-sol.com/mailman/listinfo/cpanrpm">mailing
          list</a> and if you have any interest in this area then we would
          welcome your input. Please subscribe to the mailing list.</p>
-->

        <p>If you have any questions about our RPMs or would like to suggest
          new CPAN modules for us to convert to RPMs then please email
          <a href="mailto:rpm@mag-sol.com">rpm@mag-sol.com</a>.</p>
